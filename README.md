# üè™ Online Store Sales Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing sales data from an online store to uncover insights on sales trends, product performance, and customer behavior. The analysis was conducted using Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Jupyter Notebook.

## üìä Analysis Roadmap

### 1. Total Sales Analysis

Sales were analyzed across multiple dimensions to identify patterns:

- **By Country**:  
  *The United Kingdom recorded the highest sales and most frequent orders.*

- **By Month**:  
  *November showed the highest total sales.*

- **By Week**:  
  *Week 49 recorded the highest sales.*

### üîç2. Top 10 Products Analysis

The top products were identified using three key metrics:

- **Frequently Ordered Products**
- **Most Sold Products (by Total Quantity)**
- **Most Sold Products (by Total Sales Revenue)**

---

### 3. Unit Price Group Analysis

Products were categorized based on their unit price into:

- `Low_Price_Group`
- `Average_Price_Group`
- `High_Price_Group`

#### Insights from each price group:

| Price Group       | Top 10 Frequently Ordered | Top 10 Most Sold (Quantity) | Top 10 Most Sold (Sales) |
|-------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Low Price**     | 1 Products                | 5 Products                  | 1 Product                |
| **Average Price** | 5 Products                | 5 Products                  | 5 Products               |
| **High Price**    | 4 Products                | 0 Products                  | 4 Products               |

### 4. Customer Loyalty Analysis

Customer loyalty was assessed based on invoice frequency:

- **Loyal Customers**:  
  *Customers with more than one invoice record.*

- **Lapsed Customers**:  
  *Customers who made a purchase only once.*

---

### üíπ5. RFM Analysis

The **Recency**, **Frequency**, and **Monetary (RFM)** metrics were analyzed to segment and better understand customer value.

---

### üõí6. Average Basket Size

The average basket size (mean number of items per order) was calculated to gauge typical purchasing behavior.
